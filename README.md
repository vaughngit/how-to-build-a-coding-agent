## 🛠️ What We're Building

You’ll build 6 versions of a coding assistant. 

Each version adds more features:

1. **Basic Chat** — talk to Claude
2. **File Reader** — read code files
3. **File Explorer** — list files in folders
4. **Command Runner** — run shell commands
5. **File Editor** — modify files
6. **Code Search** — search your codebase with patterns

## 🧱 How It Works (Architecture)

Each agent works like this:

1. Waits for your input
2. Sends it to Claude
3. Claude may respond directly or ask to use a tool
4. The agent runs the tool (e.g., read a file)
5. Sends the result back to Claude
6. Claude gives you the final answer

We call this the **event loop** — it's like the agent's heartbeat.

        U -->|No| O
    end
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Go 1.24.2+ or [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) (recommended for easy setup)
* An **AWS account** with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) access, and a Claude model enabled in the [Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) (e.g. Claude Opus 4.6) for your region
* AWS credentials on your machine — either an **SSO profile** (`aws sso login`) or **access keys** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
* The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) (handy for SSO login and listing available models)

### 🔧 Set Up Your Environment

**Option 1: Recommended (using devenv)**

```bash
devenv shell  # Loads everything you need
```

**Option 2: Manual setup**

```bash
# Make sure Go is installed
go mod tidy
```

### 🔐 Configure AWS Bedrock Access

This workshop talks to Claude through **Amazon Bedrock** (not the direct Anthropic API), authenticating with your standard AWS credentials — no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required.

#### Option A: A config file (no env vars to export) — recommended

Copy the example and fill in your profile, region, and model:

```bash
cp bedrock.json.example bedrock.json
```

```json
{
  "aws_profile": "your-sso-profile",
  "aws_region": "us-east-1",
  "model": "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1"
}
```

Each program reads `./bedrock.json` automatically on startup — so you can just `aws sso login --profile your-sso-profile` once and run. `bedrock.json` is git-ignored, so your settings stay local. Point at a different file with the `-config` flag or `BEDROCK_CONFIG` env var:

```bash
go run chat.go -config ~/.config/bedrock.json
```

#### Option B: Environment variables

Any of these override the matching value in `bedrock.json`, so they're handy for one-off runs:

```bash
# SSO profile (recommended)
aws sso login --profile your-profile
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# ...or static access keys
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### Picking your model

Settings resolve in this order: **`-model` flag** (chat.go only) → **`BEDROCK_MODEL` env** → **`bedrock.json`** → built-in default (`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`). List the inference-profile IDs available to your account with:

```bash
aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region us-east-1 \
  --query "inferenceProfileSummaries[].inferenceProfileId" --output text
```

```bash
# examples
export BEDROCK_MODEL="us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8"
go run chat.go -model us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8
```

## 🏁 Start with the Basics

### 1. `chat.go` — Basic Chat

A simple chatbot that talks to Claude.

```bash
go run chat.go
```

* ➡️ Try: “Hello!”
* ➡️ Add `--verbose` to see detailed logs

---

## 🛠️ Add Tools (One Step at a Time)

### 2. `read.go` — Read Files

Now Claude can read files from your computer.

```bash
go run read.go
```

* ➡️ Try: “Read fizzbuzz.js”

---

### 3. `list_files.go` — Explore Folders

Lets Claude look around your directory.

```bash
go run list_files.go
```

* ➡️ Try: “List all files in this folder”
* ➡️ Try: “What’s in fizzbuzz.js?”

---

### 4. `bash_tool.go` — Run Shell Commands

Allows Claude to run safe terminal commands.

```bash
go run bash_tool.go
```

* ➡️ Try: “Run git status”
* ➡️ Try: “List all .go files using bash”

---

### 5. `edit_tool.go` — Edit Files

Claude can now **modify code**, create files, and make changes.

```bash
go run edit_tool.go
```

* ➡️ Try: “Create a Python hello world script”
* ➡️ Try: “Add a comment to the top of fizzbuzz.js”

---

### 6. `code_search_tool.go` — Search Code

Use pattern search (powered by [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)).

```bash
go run code_search_tool.go
```

* ➡️ Try: “Find all function definitions in Go files”
* ➡️ Try: “Search for TODO comments”

---

## 🧪 Sample Files (Already Included)

1. `fizzbuzz.js`: for file reading and editing
1. `riddle.txt`: a fun text file to explore
1. `AGENT.md`: info about the project environment

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

**Auth / 403 errors?**

* Confirm your credentials resolve: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
* Using SSO and seeing `403 ... Invalid API Key format` or an expired-token error? Refresh your session: `aws sso login --profile your-profile`
* Make sure the Claude model is **enabled** for your account in the [Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for the region in `AWS_REGION`
* Make sure `AWS_REGION` matches your `BEDROCK_MODEL` prefix (e.g. `us.` → `us-east-1`)

**Go errors?**

* Run `go mod tidy`
* Make sure you’re using Go 1.24.2 or later

**Tool errors?**

* Use `--verbose` for full error logs
* Check file paths and permissions

**Environment issues?**

* Use `devenv shell` to avoid config problems

---

## 💡 How Tools Work (Under the Hood)

Tools are like plugins. You define:

* **Name** (e.g., `read_file`)
* **Input Schema** (what info it needs)
* **Function** (what it does)

Example tool definition in Go:

```go
var ToolDefinition = ToolDefinition{
    Name:        "read_file",
    Description: "Reads the contents of a file",
    InputSchema: GenerateSchema[ReadFileInput](),
    Function:    ReadFile,
}
```

Schema generation uses Go structs — so it’s easy to define and reuse.

## 🧭 Workshop Path: Learn by Building

| Phase | What to Focus On                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | `chat.go`: API integration and response handling |
| **2** | `read.go`: Tool system, schema generation        |
| **3** | `list_files.go`: Multiple tools, file system     |
| **4** | `bash_tool.go`: Shell execution, error capture   |
| **5** | `edit_tool.go`: File editing, safety checks      |
| **6** | `code_search_tool.go`: Pattern search, ripgrep   |

---

## 🛠️ Developer Environment (Optional)

If you use [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/), it gives you:

* Go, Node, Python, Rust, .NET
* Git and other dev tools

```bash
devenv shell   # Load everything
devenv test    # Run checks
hello          # Greeting script
```

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

Once you complete the workshop, try building:

* Custom tools (e.g., API caller, web scraper)
* Tool chains (run tools in a sequence)
* Memory features (remember things across sessions)
* A web UI for your agent
* Integration with other AI models

---

## 📦 Summary
